# First Principles of Modern Java Cloud Engineering

A technical book for developers who want to deeply understand—not just use—the technologies required for enterprise Java cloud development.

## Philosophy

This book follows a **First Principles Approach**: we start from fundamental truths. Before explaining AWS, we explain what a server is. Before Docker, we explain what a process is. Before microservices, we explain why monoliths exist.

Every chapter builds **mental models** readers can reason with, not just facts to memorize.
